# Men I Trust Countdown

This was for sure a fan project lol. I wanted to build a simple countdown to a Men I Trust concert (big fan). I though this could be a good excuse to try making timers and work on page layout and vibes. 

It ended up being a fun way to combine function with aesthetic â€” keeping the style clean and the countdown accurate. I also started to understand how JavaScript works with time and events on a page.

Not groundbreaking, but it made me feel like I could actually build things people might use.
my favorite part is that it plays men i trust songs and I added some of my favorites. also reslly enjoy the constant animation and aesthetics
